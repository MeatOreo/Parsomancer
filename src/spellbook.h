we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike \
men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the \
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded \
by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain \
and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal \
blame belongs to those who fail in their duty \
through weakness of will, which is the same as \
saying through shrinking from toil and pain. \
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to \
distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of \
choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents \
our being able to do what we like best, every \
pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. \
But in certain circumstances and owing to the \
claims of duty or the obligations of business \
it will frequently occur that pleasures have \
to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. \
The wise man therefore always holds in these \
matters to this principle of selection: \
he rejects pleasures to secure other greater \
pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid \
worse pains."
